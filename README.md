## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this repository is to:

- Document major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**.
- Showcase understanding of frontend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices.
- Provide a reference guide for learners.
- Encourage collaboration between **frontend** and **backend** learners.

## 🧭 Overview of the ProDev Engineering Program

The ProDev Engineering Program (Frontend & Backend tracks) is designed to equip learners with industry-ready skills in modern application development. While the backend learners focus on building scalable APIs and systems, frontend learners focus on building user interfaces and seamless application experiences. Collaboration between both groups is essential to complete full-stack projects.
